I don't think that one day people will read this in my profile, but ok, I will introduce myself.

* I am a control and automation engineer graduated at UNIFEI
* At the moment I am working in projects using PHP's Slim Framework and Python's FastAPI
* Slim Framework and PHP are for my daily job and Python is the language I love
* I am always learning and still have a long way to go
